### Assignment requirements:
Create a proposal for a (serious) game that uses data to address a social or cultural issue, or brings to light a social or cultural issue in relation to datafication. Illustrate the game with a prototype or storyboard. Keep in mind the gaming platform, genres, etc.
Write a rationale that discusses your game in relation to concepts from the literature. How does the game use "play" to create meaning and achieve rhetorical goals? 


### Ideas:
An indie horror-esque game in either the point & click genre (like Fran Bow or Little Misfortune) or the puzzle-adventure genre (like Little Nightmares 1 & 2 or Inside & Limbo) that comments on the lack of and disappearance of public transport in the countryside. Thus, making it impossible for many countryside village/small-town inhabitants who are now essentially disconnected from the outside world, to get anywhere with the joyfully advertised but really quite poor public transport. 
Plot: teenager or pre-teen age child needs to get to school but arrives at the bus stop as a municipality man puts a big “dissolved” sticker on the sign. No longer able to get to school via public transport they start on a dangerous journey, encountering harsh weather conditions, creepy and strange situations, tests of strength and perseverance and roadblocks along the way. (This journey could be done on either bicycle or foot, or maybe even incorporate both [for example the bike breaks or cannot go over a roadblock and thus our hero(ine) must continue on foot]).

### Engagement with week 3’s texts:
The simulative nature of a (video)game creates an environment where people may deliberate and challenge ideas on society and culture (Flanagan, 2009)
Videogames can cultivate an experience of a cultural or societal problem in the player (Flanagan, 2009).

### The addressed societal problem:
There is a lack of proper public transport in the Netherlands, and this has only been declining over the last few years.
This lack leads to social, economic, and ecological problems and disproportionally affects people 25 and under and those with a lower income (Pointer and Zijlstra et al, 2018).
It has become clear that the matter of properly working, accessible and convenient for all public transport has been more and more based on economic considerations than the social function it is meant to serve.


### How datafication impacts this societal problem:
The Dutch government is making plans for a “smarter” public transport (Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat, 2019)
In line with the “smarter city” initiatives happening around the world, collected data and data-collecting devices on public transport usually are implemented to gauge the optimal routes, travel times, and amount of passengers. However, it does not take into account the actual needs of these and potential passengers nor does it take into account the societal function that public transport is supposed to serve. Thus, when policymakers and public transport companies make their decisions based on this data, the total societal gain would actually be a loss.


### Underlying reality in the Game

#### Background
Bus transport is under pressure, especially in rural areas. Almost empty buses are not profitable for the carrier, but the quality of life does depend on it. Because what if, as a student, you can no longer come home after a lecture? Some villages are no longer accessible by public transport in the evenings and on weekends, while a bus runs every five minutes in the city. This creates inequality of opportunity, experts say. Is it time for a lower limit? Does every village have the right to a bus line?


The number of bus stops in the Netherlands has fallen by 7 percent over the past five years, according to research by regional broadcasters. The number went from more than 22,100 to more than 20,600. This means, among other things, that there are now 67 more villages without a boarding point within built-up areas. The differences are large regionally and locally. The number of stops decreased most in Drenthe (-17 percent) and Groningen (-15 percent). On balance, stops were added in Zeeland (+1 percent) and Flevoland (+1 percent). Transport poverty means when some people have fewer opportunities or options for transportation compared to others. This often happens in rural or less developed areas, making it hard for these people to access jobs and educations.

#### The reasons for transport poverty include 
1. a lack of public transportation options - inadequate government investment and economic inequalities.(Homeless/drunk teenager/A thief smoking pot part: government budgets are limited and need to address many social issues such as homeless, safety or adolescent problems. Whether enough funding goes to solving transport poverty depends on government priorities, public demand, and the economic situation, so rural areas are edged) . Resources for transportation tend to be concentrated more in urban areas or cities. This is because there are more people there, and the demand for transportation is higher. As a result, rural areas or small villages often get less investment and fewer transportation services. 
high costs of private transportation (Buying e-bike part)
2. poor infrastructure
3. geographical isolation of certain areas
4. the privatization of public transport systems：When public transport is operated by private companies, their main goal is often profit（digitalfication part）. This can result in reduced services in areas that are less profitable, such as rural or low-income areas, contributing to transport poverty for residents in those areas.


The outcomes of transport poverty can be quite significant. It can lead to social isolation for people living in affected areas, as they may find it difficult to access employment, education, healthcare, and social activities. This can also lead to economic disadvantages, as limited transportation options can hinder economic development and opportunities in these areas. Overall, transport poverty can contribute to a cycle of poverty and limit overall quality of life.
